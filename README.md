DragonFixes is a mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous that fixes several bugs

Currently, it fixes the following bugs
* Eldritch Scion (magus archetype) - Arcane Accuracy now correctly scales off CHA instead of INT
* Extra Arcana (feat) - Now includes the Eldritch Scion versions of the arcanas, so Eldritch Scion can pick arcanas that work for them

Other fixes planned
* None at the moment

Thanks to everyone on the Owlcat Discord for putting up with my nonsense, especially Micro / Kuru / ADDB / AlterAsc
